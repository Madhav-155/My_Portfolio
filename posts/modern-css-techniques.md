# Modern CSS Techniques for Better Performance

CSS has evolved significantly over the years, offering developers powerful tools to create performant and visually stunning web experiences. In this post, we'll explore some modern CSS techniques that can dramatically improve your website's performance.

## CSS Grid vs Flexbox

**CSS Grid** is perfect for two-dimensional layouts, while **Flexbox** excels at one-dimensional arrangements. Understanding when to use each can significantly impact your layout performance.

### CSS Grid Benefits:
- Reduces the need for complex calculations
- Eliminates float-based hacks
- Provides better browser optimization

### Flexbox Advantages:
- Excellent for component-level layouts
- Dynamic sizing capabilities
- Superior alignment control

## Custom Properties (CSS Variables)

CSS custom properties enable dynamic theming and reduce code duplication:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
}
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations** - These properties are GPU-accelerated
2. **Implement `contain` property** - Helps browsers optimize rendering
3. **Minimize repaints and reflows** - Avoid changing layout-affecting properties

## Conclusion

Modern CSS techniques not only make development easier but also create more performant web applications. By leveraging these tools effectively, you can build websites that are both beautiful and fast.
